Welcome to the documentation! This tool dumps offsets for Roblox.

## What is Roblox Dumper?

Roblox Dumper is a tool that connects to a running Roblox game and automatically scans memory to find offsets for various classes and properties. It generates an `offsets.hpp` file that you can use in your own external/projects.

## Quick Start

1. [Install the dumper](/install) - Download the tool
2. [Configure your game](/configuration) - Set up game IDs and user information
3. [Run the tool](/running-the-tool) - Step-by-step guide to using the dumper
4. [View everything dumped](/everything-dumped) - See what gets extracted

## Features

- Support for custom games that uploaded the rblx file from the github or the published dumper game
- Generates ready-to-use C++ header files
- Dumps Instance, Part, Player, Camera, and many more classes

## Want More Offsets?

Need additional offsets that aren't currently dumped? Reach out on Discord: **jonahw** - I'll try to support new offsets for the community.

If you'd like to implement it yourself, feel free to create a pull request on GitHub!

Get started by checking out the [Installation Guide](/install)!
